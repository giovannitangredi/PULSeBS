## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

  - We underestimate some tasks especially about Unit Testing.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

  - We decided to have less stories but we were able to satisfy the DoD and resolve all the Technical Debt.
  - We need to increase the amount of time we spent on unit testing.
  - Person that have more time to spend can work on increase the test coverage.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?
  - We did achieve all  the improvement goals from the previous retrospective .
- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
  - Improve Coverage of unit testing.
  - Try to finish the core part early so that we can start testing more in advance.

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  - We improved time management, communication and work on system testing respect to last week , we keep sprint meeting short
