## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

  - We underestimate some stories because we didn't consider the dependencies between the stories.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

  - We must consider all the dependencies between the stories so we can plan and work better.
  - We need to increase the amount of time we spent on system testing

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?
  - We didn't achieve the improvement goals from the previous retrospective .
- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

  - Do not exceed the assigned 6 hours per week.
  - Put more effort in system testing to avoid bugs and produce some formal documentation for the tests.

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  - We put a lot of effort in this sprint and despite the difficulties we were still able to complete more stories than the last sprint.
