## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

  - We underestimated our expirience and the difficulty of the testing framework.
  - We underestimate some tasks because we didn't account for different knowlage within the team.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

  - We must take account of the different technical skills of each team member.
  - We must consider that project configuration can take a while.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?
  - We achived all the previous retrospective improvement goals.
- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
- Maching the estimate hours with the spent hours.
- Try to assign tasks to team members according to their skills.

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  - We have completed all stories we have commited and we achived the previous retrospective improvement goals.
