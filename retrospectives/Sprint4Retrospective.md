## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

  - We underestimate some tasks especially about Unit Testing.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

  - We learned to distribute the work in evenly manner so that everyone could finished his work in the assigned time.
  - We finished working on the stories development part some days before the deadline so that we could be more focused on code review and on increasing code coverage.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?
  - We did achieve all  the improvement goals from the previous retrospective .
- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
  - Mantain the same code coverage level.
  - Create autometed E2E tests.

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  - We were all committed to the project and each person took it's own responsabilities  from the first sprint to this last one.
